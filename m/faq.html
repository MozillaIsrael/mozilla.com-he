  <h3>Why Firefox for mobile phones?</h3>

  <p>Bringing Firefox to mobile phones is the next step towards fulfilling Mozilla's mission of providing access to one Web that everyone can access, regardless of device or location. The most advanced browser available, Firefox is fast, secure, customizable and syncs perfectly with the Firefox on your desktop.</p>

  <h3>Does it cost anything?</h3>

  <p>No. Firefox was created as part of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation's commitment to providing openness, innovation and opportunity on the Internet. <a href="/about/whatismozilla.html">Learn more</a>.</p>

  <h3>How is the Firefox browser different from the mobile browser I have now?</h3>

  <p>Built on the most modern browser engine available, Firefox comes complete with familiar features like the "Awesome Bar", Password Manager, One-touch bookmarking, Location-Aware Browsing and more. Firefox is also the first mobile Web browser to offer add-ons, enabling users to customize their browser on the go.</p>

  <h2 id="security">Security</h2>

  <h3>How will Firefox keep me safe while I browse on my mobile?</h3>

  <p>Mozilla upholds the utmost security and privacy standards. Web site ID that checks on suspicious sites to ensure they're what they claim to be, as well as customizable security settings to manage passwords, cookies, loading images and installing add-ons give you complete control over your browsing experience. <a href="./privacy.html">Learn more</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="using">Using Firefox</h2>

  <h3>How do I use the Firefox user interface to browse the Web?</h3>

  <p>Firefox controls are stowed away to the sides of the screen. They can be accessed by swiping your finger left or right across the screen. Your tabs are on the left side of the screen, while bookmarks and settings are on the right. The address bar also disappears when you scroll down, but reappears by swiping up or to the side.</p>

  <h3>How do I zoom in and out?</h3>

  <p>Double tap the screen with your finger to zoom in. To zoom out, double tap with your finger again.</p>

  <h3>How do I bookmark a Web page?</h3>

  <p>Go to the site you wish to bookmark. Touch the bookmark "star" button on the right side of your display.</p>

  <h3>How do I open a new tab?</h3>

  <p>Touch the new tab "plus" button on the left side of your display screen to open a new tab. Tabs appear as thumbnails so you can easily see which page you'd like to select.</p>

  <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

  <h3>What's so special about the Awesome Bar?</h3>

  <p>The Awesome Bar gets you where you want to go quickly. Touch the Awesome Bar and begin typing. As you type it will display websites that you visit frequent or have recently visited or bookmarked. The Awesome Bar learns as you use it, adapting to your preferences and making your browsing more personal. You can also tap the Awesome Bar to enter a URL or search term and start exploring the Web.</p>

  <h3>What are Firefox add-ons and how can I get them on my mobile device?</h3>

  <p>Add-ons let you customize your Firefox by adding features. Select the settings "gear" button on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, then choose the add-ons "puzzle piece" button and search for and install the add-ons that are most useful to you directly from your phone.</p>

  <h3>How can I share my Firefox bookmarks, history, tabs and more between my PC and my mobile?</h3>

  <p>The Weave add-on brings your Firefox experience to your mobile phone. First, create a Weave account on your PC. Then go to Firefox on your mobile and select the pre-installed Weave add-on. When you enter your Weave account info and sync, your Firefox preferences, history and more will be shared between your PC and your mobile.</p>

  <h3>Do I need to get the Weave add-on to use Firefox on my phone?</h3>

  <p>No. Although we think syncing Firefox between your PC and your mobile with Weave is super useful, it is an optional service that you can choose to use or not. You can still enjoy the Firefox you trust and expect without it. Weave allows you to share your history, bookmarks, preferences and more, enhancing your overall browsing experience wherever you are.</p>

  <h3>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</h3>

  <p>Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your location with a website, it can use that information to find nearby points of interest and return additional, useful data like maps of your area. It's all optional &ndash; Firefox doesn't share your location without your permission.</p>

  <h3>How accurate are the locations?</h3>

  <p>Accuracy varies greatly from location to location. In some places, our service providers may be able to provide a location within a few meters. However, in other areas it might be much more than that. All locations returned by our service providers are estimates only and we do not guarantee the accuracy of the locations provided.</p>

  <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>

  <p>Your contributions lead to the success of Firefox. Check out our <a href="../mobile/developers/">Develop for Mobile</a> page to learn more about how you can contribute to Mozilla's mobile project.
