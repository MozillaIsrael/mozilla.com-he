<h3>Boo! I&#8217;m a naughty web page trying to steal your identity!</h3>

<p>OK, not really, but web forgeries (also known as <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> pages) are out 
there on the Internet, and you should always use caution before giving 
your personal information to a web page. Firefox 2 provides built-in <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/anti-phishing/">Phishing
Protection</a> to help you identify web forgeries. If you're using
Firefox 2, you should have been warned away from this page.</p>

<p>You can also make yourself safe from web forgeries by:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
    <li>not following links from your e-mail to banks or online commerce sites; instead, use your bookmarks or type in the web page address by hand;</li>
    <li>use the Firefox Password Manager to remember your passwords instead of entering them manually;</li>
    <li>using an e-mail product like <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, which detects and alerts you when it finds links to web forgeries in your e-mail.</li>
</ul>
