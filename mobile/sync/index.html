    <h3>Why Get Weave Sync?</h3>

    <h4>Typing is hard</h4>
    <p>Let’s face it, typing on your mobile is difficult. A bid farewell to typing long URLs and search terms when the Awesome Bar remembers your history, bookmarks and tabs from both your PC and mobile, quickly getting you where you want to go and with very little typing.</p>

    <h4>Don’t start from scratch</h4>
    <p>Say goodbye to resetting and retyping. Weave Sync syncs your Firefox passwords and preferences, so you can hit the ground running.</p>

    <h4>Get up and go</h4>
    <p>Take your Firefox with you wherever you go. Surf the Web on your PC, get up and go, and have everything waiting for you on your phone: your history, open tabs, bookmarks, the Awesome Bar - just as you had left it.</p>
